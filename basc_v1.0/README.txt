** What is Basc? **

Basc is a MATLAB package that computes best constrained approximants by solving semidefinite programs. It relies on the external softwares Chebfun and CVX, which are included in the Basc folder you have downloaded.


** Which Basc version is this? **

This is version 1.0.

Testing
-------------

** How do I start using Basc? **

Open MATLAB and go to the directory basc_v1.0 (the one containing this README.txt file). From there, activate the software by typing

basc_setup

You should then be able to call the generic basc command from any directory. For instance, you can go into the subdirectory called documentation and run the usage examples from reproducible.m that were included in the original article
"Basc: constrained approximation by semidefinite programming"
by S. Foucart and V. Powers.


** Does Basc come with any guarantee of accuracy? ** 

Absolutely not. Basc started as an academic exercise and it contains undoubtedly many bugs at this stage. We encourage you to send us bug reports at
